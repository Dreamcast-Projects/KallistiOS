    \brief   PVR/TA DMA interface.
    \ingroup pvr

    This file provides support for PVR DMA and TA DMA transfers in the 
    Dreamcast. These DMA types can be used independently of each other, 
    and both can operate concurrently. Depending on the transfer method 
    specified, the appropriate DMA mechanism is selected.

    TA DMA (Tile Accelerator DMA): This is a one-way transfer method used 
    primarily for submitting data directly to the Tile Accelerator (TA). It is 
    commonly used for submitting vertex data, texture data, and YUV conversion 
    data.

    PVR DMA (PowerVR DMA): This is a more flexible, two-way transfer mechanism 
    that supports both uploading and downloading data. PVR DMA is used for 
    transferring textures and palette data to VRAM, downloading data from VRAM 
    to the SH4, and for handling register data (e. palettes, fog tables).
